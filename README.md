# Development

The frontend of this project was already provided in our initial setup environment.

This application is hosted and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). For the database, I used [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/).

For server development we used [Express](https://expressjs.com/). 

For development this project used [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.
